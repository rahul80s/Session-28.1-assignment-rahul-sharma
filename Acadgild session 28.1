Problem Statement

1. You are expected to submit the steps you followed for doing all the below subtasks.

• Use the “Sales_Data.xml” file.

• Access the “xml” file in excel and save it to a comma delimited “csv” file.

• Make all the rows where “attractiveness<6” to

  background color = red, font = 8, font type = italic. 
  
Ans ==> by using Conditional Formating, then go to Highlight Cell Rules, then click on Less Than OR we can go to More Rules from where we can use the required formatting.

• Hide All the rows where “attractiveness<6” by using grouping. Hide in the sense, we should be able to see there is some rows there, which we can unfold to see. Also try hiding the data without grouping.  

Ans ==>  We need to select the row or column, then click on group or use the shortcut ALT+SHIFT+ARROW RIGHT

• Use the same data. The column named “attractiveness” is in general format. It is actually a rating from 1 to 10. 

  Can you prepend “C” before the number. i.e. if it is 1, it should be converted to “C1”. 
  
Ans ==> We need to concatenate C with the numbers in the column so it will show C1, C2, etc

  Format the column to text type.
  
Ans ==> We need to use Text to Column tool under Data Tab
